Let me explain the flow of the SessionController and analyze each endpoint:

1. **Start Session** (`POST /api/session/start`)
```csharp
- Only authenticated users can start a session
- Creates a new session with:
  - HostUserId = current user's ID
  - ClientUserId = null (waiting for client to join)
  - Status = "active"
- Returns the new session ID
```

2. **Join Session** (`POST /api/session/join/{sessionId}`)
```csharp
- Only authenticated users can join
- Checks if session exists and is active
- Checks if session already has a client
- Sets ClientUserId to current user's ID
- Returns success message
```

3. **Stop Session** (`POST /api/session/stop/{sessionId}`)
```csharp
- Both host and client can stop the session
- Checks if user is either host or client of the session
- Sets session status to "ended"
- This is correct because:
  - Host might need to end session for maintenance
  - Client might need to end session if host is unresponsive
  - Both parties should have control over session termination
```

4. **Connect to Session** (`POST /api/session/connect/{sessionId}`)
```csharp
- Handles real-time connection establishment
- Sets either HostConnectionId or ClientConnectionId
- This is for real-time communication setup
```

5. **Disconnect from Session** (`POST /api/session/disconnect/{sessionId}`)
```csharp
- Only removes the connection ID
- Doesn't end the session
- User can reconnect later
- This is correct because:
  - Temporary disconnection shouldn't end the session
  - Allows reconnection without creating new session
```

6. **Get Session** (`GET /api/session/{id}`)
```csharp
- Returns session details including:
  - Session ID
  - Status
  - Host and Client usernames
  - Creation time
```

7. **Get Active Sessions** (`GET /api/session/active`)
```csharp
- Returns all active sessions where user is either host or client
- Includes session details and usernames
```

1. Add session timeout handling
2. Add automatic cleanup of ended sessions
3. Add session state validation before operations


Key improvements made:

1. Added session timeout handling:
   - Sessions automatically end after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - Added `ValidateSessionState` method to check session status and timeout

2. Added user session limits:
   - Users can't have multiple active sessions
   - Checks for existing sessions before starting/joining

3. Added better state validation:
   - Consistent session state checking across all endpoints
   - Clearer error messages for inactive sessions

4. Added activity tracking:
   - `LastActivity` field in responses
   - `UpdatedAt` timestamp updates on all operations

5. Improved error handling:
   - More specific error messages
   - Better separation of "not found" vs "not active" states

The flow is now more robust:
1. Host starts session → Gets session ID
2. Client joins session → Gets connected
3. Either party can stop session → Session ends
4. Either party can disconnect → Can reconnect later
5. Sessions auto-timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
6. Users can't have multiple active sessions

This ensures better session management and prevents potential issues like:
- Orphaned sessions
- Multiple active sessions per user
- Stuck sessions
- Unauthorized access
